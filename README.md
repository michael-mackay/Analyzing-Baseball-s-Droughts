# Baseball Analysis

As a baseball fan, I see baseball as a great way to practice data analysis on something that I am passionate about. Here is a list of analyses included in this repository.

## Analyzing Baseball's Droughts

There was particular attention set on the 2016 World Series as the Chicago Cubs were able to end a 108 year championship drought. The fact that the drought extended past the lifespan of almost every living Cubs fan to the early age of baseball raises thoughts about just how much of an outlier a 108 year drought is. Is it improbable? Or could it reasonably have been expected that some team would reach that point?

As an Indians fan I wasn't thrilled with the 2016 result. Since the Indians now hold the longest drought at 69 years, the natural question is _Are they next?_ What are the chances that Cleveland also will wait 108 years (or more) to see a world champion baseball team? And if not the Indians, what are the chances that any of baseball's teams will extend their current drought to 108?

## Deriving Player Batting Value

In an exercise in analysing MLB play-by-play data, I have derived from scratch a metric to evaluate player batting performance by, finding the overall value (in terms of runs value added) that each player provided at the plate.
